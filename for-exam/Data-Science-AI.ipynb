    "This written test of 40 multiple choice questions with 4 possible answers is about all the theory presented in the lectures. There will be no Python-specific questions. The test will contain multiple choice questions. The questions are designed to apply the knowledge obtained from the lectures to test your understanding.\n",

    "1. The actual content of the final report is 20 pages maximum. The appendix may be 20 pages maximum. The content counts from the start of your introduction to the last sentence of your last section (conclusion). \n",
    "2. Follow the guidelines in the Writing Guidelines regarding appendices, bibliography and formatting.\n",
    "3. Only use screenshots of your graphs. Make proper tables for the other components of data understanding (e.g. descriptive statistics, formulas). That is to say – no screenshots of code output. \n",
    "4. If you want to show some code to provide evidence towards fulfilling the LOs, put your code in an appendix. You may either make separate entries within that appendix with the relevant code snippets, or put your code in its entirety in one appendix and refer to the relevant lines within the text. Put the code in monospace font to discern it from regular text. Use the Word plugin for code to do this. This means also not putting in screenshots of your code.\n",
    "5. You take responsibility for paraphrasing correctly (or quoting if necessary) and the ethical use of sources, including accurate source referencing following APA guidelines. Use the standard Word functionality under References for this.\n",
